#### ASSIGNMENT 1

#### TOPICS AND EXPLANATIONS

##### Convolution

- Convolution is a method to identify or detect the patterns, objects, edges, backgrounds, colors and much more in an image with the help of filters. 
- Consider an RBG Image which has 3 channels, Now Convolution is used to isolate or group the channels and we will be having more number of images (channel wise) after convolution and it depends on the filters.

##### Filters/Kernels

- Filters are used to slide over and it transforms the image to the newly encoded pixel. We can increase or decrease the number of channels in an image respectively using the number of filters. 
- It is fully mathematical where each pixel values in the filter will have an element-wise multiplication and produce a result. 
- The number of channels in the filters and input image should be equal and normally it will not get mentioned explicitly and **so 3x3 filters is a lie**. The image size will be reduced by (n-2)*(n-2) after passing through 3x3 filters. 

##### Epochs

- One complete forward (finding the activations) and backward (finding errors and updating the weights) propagation for all the samples in the dataset is ONE Epoch. 
- Increasing the number of epochs might lead to overfitting which we can observe with the help of learning curve, the validation set error tends to increase and it memorizes the training set data.
- On the other hand, Batch size is the count of samples for which we want both propagation in the iteration. It is user defined. Iterating for all the batches is one epoch.

##### 1x1 Convolution

- It is used to decrease or increase the number of channels in an image **but not decrease the size of an image.** 
- If 10 number of 1x1 (actually it is 1x1 with 3channels) filter is getting convoluted over an image of size 50x50 with 3 channels, the result will be 50x50 image size with 10 channels. So ten images have now created detecting edges, backgrounds, patterns, objects, backgrounds, colors. 

##### 3x3 Convolution

- It is used to both increase or decrease the number of channels in an image **as well it decreases the size of an image by (n-2)*(n-2).** 
- If 10 number of 3x3 (actually it is 3x3 with 3 channels) filter is getting convoluted over an image of size 50x50 with 3 channels, the result will be 48x48 image size with 10 channels. So ten images have now created detecting edges, backgrounds, patterns, objects, backgrounds, colors.

##### Feature Maps

- Features maps are designed in such a way to capture specific patterns (It is done with the pixel values). If we are sliding our filter towards the right and then down over an image, then the specific filter captures the specific features as we slide and results it in the new image. 
- One feature map could capture curves, other could capture curves with lines and so on.

##### Feature Engineering

- In general, Feature Engineering is creating our own new features with the help of domain knowledge and it is **must in applied machine learning.** 
- In computer vision, it is the way to extract valuable features from the image, the features which helps our model to learn efficiently. Suppose if we have an small lion with a wide tail, extracting that tail features will helps our model to identify the lion efficiently.



#### BONUS POINTS TOPICS AND EXPLANATIONS

##### Activation Function

- It is for user convenience and machine convenience. Normally machine will give us the result from         (–infinity to +infinity), and for understanding and readability, we are applying any activation functions. 
- It is also used for the machine while calculating logarithmic cost functions. For example, we are applying sigmoid activation and the result is between 0 to 1, applying logarithmic to the values 0 to 1 makes easy for the machine. Examples of activation function – Sigmoid, ReLU, tanh. 

##### How to create an account on GitHub and upload a sample project

- We can create the account easily, Go the GitHub URL, choose your username and password, accept the terms, choose your plan, your account is created. 
- Uploading the project can be done via Git Bash or GitHub Desktop. 
- Once your project is done, 
  - Initialize the repository in your directory (git init).
  - Add everything in staging area (git add .).
  - Commit it(git commit -m ‘committing’).
  - Use git remote command and use the given URL to add your project(make sure you are signed in), 
  - finally push your project to GitHub.

##### Receptive Field

- Receptive field is the area to which we are applying filters. 
- Each neuron in the receptive field responses to the filters and it will produce the new channels in the convolution layer. 
- As simple, our input image is the Receptive Field.

##### 10 example of use of MathJax in Markdown

1. To use inline formulas, we have to use $....$. To use displayed formulas, we have to use $$....$$.
   - $\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}$ (inline formulas)
   - $$\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}$$ (displayed formulas)

2. To use Greek letters, we have to use \alpha, \beta,...,\omega: , To use uppercase, use \Gamma, \Delta,...,\Omega

3. To use superscripts and subscripts, we have to use ^ and _. To say in example, x_i^2: , \log_2 x:

4. To use superscripts or subscripts, we have to use curly braces, To say in example, 10^10 is an error,

   we have to use 10^{10}, this results what we wanted.

5. Parentheses uses : Ordinary symbols ()[] gives parentheses and brackets like (2+3) and [4+4].

   But we have to use curly braces in for the formulas like\{  and \} .

6. To use sums and integrals, we have to use \sum and \int  respectively. lower limit will be subscript and upper limit will be superscript. To say in example, \sum_1^n.

7. To use fractions, we have to use \frac ab, To say in example, \frac{a+1}{b+1} will give us the result.

8. To use fonts, we have to use \mathbb or \Bbb in the case of 'blackboard bold', for typewriter font - we can use \mathtt , For roman font - we can use \mathrm

9. To use Radical signs, We have to use sqrt, which itself adjusts the size of its argument.

10. To use any special functions, we have to use 'lim' , 'sin' , 'max' , 'In'.
